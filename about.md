<p class="center about"><img src="/img/linkedinpic.png" alt="" /></p>

I'm passionate about helping people solve problems by building beautiful, innovative web applications. I have experience with JavaScript and Rails and I am eager to learn new technologies. I love to collaborate with and learn from talented, motivated people and lend my skills to a broader vision. 

I'm lucky to live in the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area. When I'm not coding, I love trying new restaurants, hiking, making art, and exploring Oakland and San Francisco.
