I'm passionate about helping people solve problems by building beautiful, innovative web applications. I recently completed Bloc.io's Full Stack Development course, where I built four apps under the guidance of an experienced web developer. I love to collaborate with and learn from talented, motivated people and lend my skills to a broader vision. 

I'm lucky to live in the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area. When I'm not coding, I love trying new restaurants, hiking, making collages, and exploring Oakland and San Francisco.
